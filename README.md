What is the purpose of the software?

The purpose of the software is to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to sort and visualize data.

Where and when will the software be used?

The software can be used on any computer with a Java runtime environment installed. It is most likely to be used in academic and research settings.

How does the software work?

The software reads data from a file and stores it in an array or ArrayList data structure. It then uses a quicksort/mergesort/heapsort algorithm to sort the data. Once the data is sorted, the software can be used to visualize the data in a variety of ways.

Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?

The software offers several advantages over existing processes for sorting and visualizing data. First, it is user-friendly and easy to use. Second, it is efficient and can sort and visualize large datasets qu
